# Schematics

Description of the circuits that make up the basic modules of the DMG-CPU. Some circuitry is not necessarily in one module, a typical example is the external address bus arbiter, which is "scattered" between Arb, MMIO and APU.

Contains pieces of schematics from dmgsch (https://github.com/msinger/dmg-schematics/) for comparison with the annotated design extracted from PlanAhead.
