## DeepSeek Analysis

### Detailed Description of the DMG-CPU ClkGen & System Control Verilog Module

The `ClkGen` module is a **clock generation and system control unit** for the DMG-CPU (Game Boy CPU). It generates multiple clock signals, manages system resets, and controls external chip select and write synchronization. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality and structure.

---

### **Module Overview**
The `ClkGen` module is responsible for:
1. **Clock Generation**: Produces multiple clock signals (`clk1` to `clk9`, `cclk`) for different parts of the CPU and peripherals.
2. **Reset Management**: Handles system resets (`reset`, `n_reset2`, `sync_reset`) and ensures proper initialization.
3. **External Chip Select Control**: Manages the external chip select signal (`ext_cs_en`) for memory and peripheral access.
4. **Write Synchronization**: Synchronizes CPU write operations (`cpu_wr_sync`) with the clock.
5. **Oscillator Control**: Manages the oscillator enable (`osc_ena`) and stability (`osc_stable`) signals.

---

### **Signal Flow**
1. **Clock Generation**:
   - The external clock input (`n_clk_in`) is inverted and divided to generate multiple clock signals (`clk1` to `clk9`, `cclk`).
   - The clocks are synchronized with the oscillator enable (`osc_ena`) and stability (`osc_stable`) signals.

2. **Reset Management**:
   - The system reset signal (`reset`) is synchronized with the clock to generate `n_reset2` and `sync_reset`.
   - Flip-flops (`dmg_dffrnq_comp`) are used to debounce and synchronize the reset signals.

3. **External Chip Select Control**:
   - The `ext_cs_en` signal is generated based on the `cpu_mreq` signal and internal logic.
   - It enables external memory or peripheral access when the CPU requests it.

4. **Write Synchronization**:
   - The `cpu_wr_sync` signal is generated by synchronizing the `cpu_wr` signal with the clock.
   - It ensures that write operations are properly aligned with the clock cycles.

5. **Oscillator Control**:
   - The oscillator enable (`osc_ena`) and stability (`osc_stable`) signals are managed to ensure proper clock generation.
   - These signals ensure that the oscillator is stable before enabling clock generation.

Phase pattern of all CLK outputs:

If you see a picture like that, then you're good.

Assignment of Clocks (hypothesis, but pretty sure):
- clk1+clk2: Prechagre Clock, during clk2=0 all buses are precharged where required. Matches about the same phase as clk8+clk9, but most likely the developers made a separate clock to control the timings precisely (moving the phase slightly with delays as required).
- clk3+clk4: M-cycle Clock (T รท 4)
- clk5+clk6: Last T-cycle (3) of the current M-cycle (@ posedge clk6)
- clk7: Used for Overlap technique when the circuit "completes" something on the 0th T-cycle of the next M-cycle (e.g. used for fetch-execute overlap in SM83 Core) (@ negedge clk7)
- clk8+clk9: First T-cycle (0) of the current M-cycle (@ posedge clk9)

To get the "middle" T-cycles (1 and 2) you can use a bit of logic, for instance "If clk4=1 and clk5=0, then the 2nd T-cycle is now being executed".
