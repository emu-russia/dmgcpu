### Detailed Description of the DMG-CPU ClkGen & System Control Verilog Module

The `ClkGen` module is a **clock generation and system control unit** for the DMG-CPU (Game Boy CPU). It generates multiple clock signals, manages system resets, and controls external chip select and write synchronization. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality and structure.

---

### **Module Overview**
The `ClkGen` module is responsible for:
1. **Clock Generation**: Produces multiple clock signals (`clk1` to `clk9`, `cclk`) for different parts of the CPU and peripherals.
2. **Reset Management**: Handles system resets (`reset`, `n_reset2`, `sync_reset`) and ensures proper initialization.
3. **External Chip Select Control**: Manages the external chip select signal (`ext_cs_en`) for memory and peripheral access.
4. **Write Synchronization**: Synchronizes CPU write operations (`cpu_wr_sync`) with the clock.
5. **Oscillator Control**: Manages the oscillator enable (`osc_ena`) and stability (`osc_stable`) signals.

---

### **Signal Flow**
1. **Clock Generation**:
   - The external clock input (`n_clk_in`) is inverted and divided to generate multiple clock signals (`clk1` to `clk9`, `cclk`).
   - The clocks are synchronized with the oscillator enable (`osc_ena`) and stability (`osc_stable`) signals.

2. **Reset Management**:
   - The system reset signal (`reset`) is synchronized with the clock to generate `n_reset2` and `sync_reset`.
   - Flip-flops (`dmg_dffrnq_comp`) are used to debounce and synchronize the reset signals.

3. **External Chip Select Control**:
   - The `ext_cs_en` signal is generated based on the `cpu_mreq` signal and internal logic.
   - It enables external memory or peripheral access when the CPU requests it.

4. **Write Synchronization**:
   - The `cpu_wr_sync` signal is generated by synchronizing the `cpu_wr` signal with the clock.
   - It ensures that write operations are properly aligned with the clock cycles.

5. **Oscillator Control**:
   - The oscillator enable (`osc_ena`) and stability (`osc_stable`) signals are managed to ensure proper clock generation.
   - These signals ensure that the oscillator is stable before enabling clock generation.
