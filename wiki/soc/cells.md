## Symmetry group

- In general, the dihedral group 4 (D4) is used for cells
- As part of modules, cells are usually simply reflected relative to the vertical axis (for ClkGen and Div modules, cells are additionally rotated “sideways”)
- As part of macro cells (memory), cells can be arranged arbitrarily, as is more convenient
