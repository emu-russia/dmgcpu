## module3 - dff_posedge_comp

DFF on a complementary CLK (Dual Rails).

Since the polarity of CLKs is now known (CLK9 = CLK, CLK8 = CCLK), we can say for sure that it is posedge DFF.

In fact, when using Dual Rails, you can easily turn a posedge DFF into a negedge by simply rearranging the CLK complement signals.
(and moreover this is what is done for `g84`, turning it into negedge dff)

A distinctive feature of the circuits that do Edge Detection is the two serial MUX's that are opened complementary to the CLK. Using black magic and propagation delay - the edge of the signal is caught.

![module3_tran](/imgstore/sm83/modules/module3_tran.jpg)

Note: If the DFF input goes to a MUX, which opens at CLK=0 by a P-type MOSFET, it is a posedge DFF.

## module4 - rs_latch

A typical static latch, but made quite compact. The impressive gates on the FlipFlop, where the value is stored, are also a distinguishing feature.

Also: reset input in inverse polarity (`#RESET`).

:warning: The module design is such that reset overrides set if both are set at the same time. Keep this in mind when making your HDL implementation.

## module4_2 - rs_latch2

Initially it was mistaken for module4, but after a detailed study it became clear that the lower part is different.

![module42](/imgstore/sm83/modules/module42.jpg)

![module42_tran](/imgstore/sm83/modules/module42_tran.jpg)

This is essentially the same rs_latch (see above), but with the inputs rearranged. The cell occurs in a single instance (g49) and Issue #219 was associated with it.

(I rechecked all the other modules4).

## aoi_1 - aoi_21

1 AND x2 to OR inverted.

## huge1 - latchr_comp

Latch with Active-High reset and complementary set enable, complementary CLK.

A rather complicated circuit to master:
- In the middle is a FlipFlop made of not and nor (nor is used for resetting)
- Input value can be written to FlipFlop only if CLK=1 and LD=1
- When LD=0 the FlipFlop value is updated with the old value
- The output contains a DLatch with a gate memory that opens when LD=0 (so that the old value is returned during the write (LD=1))
- So the written value becomes relevant when LD 1->0 changes (when the output latch opens and is updated with the value from FlipFlop). The same applies to resetting if you do it at the same time as LD=1.
- The whole thing is complicated by the complementary layout of the LD and CLK signals.

By the way, there are 2 `not` in the circuit to form the complement, one of which takes `CLK6` signal as input and the second `not` takes `LoadIR` signal as input.

## hmm1 - oai_21

1 OR x2 to AND inverted.

![hmm1_tran](/imgstore/sm83/modules/hmm1_tran.jpg)

## hmm2 - aoi_31

1 AND x3 to OR inverted.

![hmm2](/imgstore/sm83/modules/hmm2.jpg)

![hmm2_tran](/imgstore/sm83/modules/hmm2_tran.jpg)

## hmm3 - latch_comp

Latch, complementary CLK.

Latch means that the value is written on the CLK level, not on the edge of the signal, as in DFF.

Output in inverse polarity (`#Q`).

![hmm3](/imgstore/sm83/modules/hmm3.jpg)

![hmm3_tran](/imgstore/sm83/modules/hmm3_tran.jpg)

:warning: Note that CLK comes to this cell in complement, relative to the other DFFs. This cell is used to edge detect the NMI signal (or more precisely its derivative /NMI obtained from g53).

## iwantsleep - oai_21

1 OR x2 to AND inverted.

## shielded - mreq

Very cleverly twisted combined logic. Bravo, SHARP engineers!

This module is essentially used to generate the `#MREQ` signal. Below is `not` to invert it into a `MREQ` signal and output it to the outside.

## Logic behind additional Decoder inputs

From @Gekkio's research we know the purpose of additional inputs of Decoder1.

The first two are obvious: Sequencer is in interrupt sequence mode or in opcode processing state from `CB` table.

The other three are "State\[3\]", encoding a timestamp for executing long instructions. Initially it appeared to be a counter, but it turns out that setting the states is more complicated and so the bits are simply called State0-2.

|Extra Decoder1 Input|Meaning|
|---|---|
|a1|1: IRQ sequence in progress (Gekkio: intr_dispatch)|
|a3|1: CB Opcode prefix (Gekkio: cb_mode)|
|a20|#State2 (0: state2 active)|
|a22|#State1 (0: state1 active)|
|a24|#State0 (0: state0 active)|

(the names of the states given here in inverse polarity, because Gekkio takes their names from the corresponding DFFs but they go to the specified decoder inputs in inverse polarity).

## Logisim

An adaptation of the HDL schematic in Logisim has been made for better understanding.
