| Signal Name           | Direction | From / Where To           | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| BUS_DISABLE           | Input     | MMIO                      | Test1 mode enable (disable all internal CPU A/D bus drivers) |
| CLK1+CLK2             | Input     | ClkGen                    | Prechagre Clock, during clk2=0 all buses are precharged where required. Matches about the same phase as clk8+clk9, but most likely the developers made a separate clock to control the timings precisely (moving the phase slightly with delays as required) |
| CLK3+CLK4             | Input     | ClkGen                    | M-cycle Clock (T รท 4) |
| CLK5+CLK6             | Input     | ClkGen                    | Last T-cycle (3) of the current M-cycle (@ posedge clk6) |
| CLK7                  | Input     | ClkGen                    | Used for Overlap technique when the circuit "completes" something on the 0th T-cycle of the next M-cycle (e.g. used for fetch-execute overlap in SM83 Core) (@ negedge clk7) |
| CLK8+CLK9             | Input     | ClkGen                    | First T-cycle (0) of the current M-cycle (@ posedge clk9) |
| \[7:0\] CPU_IRQ_TRIG  | Input     | MMIO                      | Triggers IRQ. Bits 5-7 connected to GND |
| IPL_DISABLE           | Input     | MMIO                      | Test2 mode enable (disable the internal Boot ROM) |
| IPL_REQ               | Input     | Arb                       | Arb boot_sel |
| MMIO_REQ              | Input     | Arb                       | Arb mmio_sel |
| NMI                   | Input     | From Pad                  | Directly connected to an input /NMI pad at the top of the die, which is not bonded |
| OSC_STABLE            | Input     | MMIO                      | Active-high crystal oscillator stablilized input? After reset, this signal gets high after about 32 milliseconds |
| RESET                 | Input     | From Pad                  | Active-high asynchronous reset input. Fed directly from /RST input pad |
| SYNC_RESET            | Input     | ClkGen                    | Active-high synchronous reset input. Synchronized to CLK8/CLK9 |
| WAKE                  | Input     | APU                       | Wakes CPU from STOP mode |
| \[15:0\] A            | Output    | Global                    | SoC internal address bus |
| CLK_ENA               | Output    | MMIO                      |  |
| \[7:0\] CPU_IRQ_ACK   | Output    | MMIO                      | Acknowledges IRQ. Bits 5-7 not connected |
| \[7:0\] D             | Bidir     | Global                    | SoC internal data bus |
| MREQ                  | Output    | Arb, ClkGen               | Active-high external memory request |
| M1                    | Output    | MMIO                      | The M1 signal is 1 when the next opcode is fetched |
| OSC_ENA               | Output    | MMIO                      | Crystal oscillator enable. When CPU drives this low, the crystal oscillator gets disabled to save power. This happens during STOP mode |
| RD                    | Output    | MMIO                      | Active-high memory RD signal from CPU |
| WR                    | Output    | MMIO                      | Active-high memory WR signal from CPU |
