# Bottom

![locator_bottom](/imgstore/sm83/locator_bottom.png)

The SM83 processor uses a typical layout from the 70-80's: the "brain" is on top and the registers and ALUs are on the bottom.

The upper part outputs to the lower part a large number of control signals for connecting registers to buses, ALU operations, etc.

For the SM83 the layout is slightly different: the ALU is on the top-left and at the bottom purely registers and auxiliary logic for switching buses.

## Design

![Bottom](/HDL/sm83/Design/Bottom.png)

The bottom part consists of 8 lanes, according to the number of registers bits. The numbering of the bits is from 0 from top to bottom.

There are minor differences between the lanes, such places are marked with a :warning: sign.

The components of the bottom are divided into subsections to make it easier to understand:
- [Registers Block](regs.md)
- [Increment/Decrement Unit](idu.md)
- [IRQ Logic](irq.md)

## Bottom Left (ALU bc/bq) Logic

The circuit is on the left side in a spread out layout. The picture shows the parts of the circuit for the individual parts.

It is very difficult to put this circuit into any category. It belongs to both ALU and registers at the same time, and is generally at the bottom. So it's going to stay here untouched for now.
