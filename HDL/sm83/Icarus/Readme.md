# SM83 Core Icarus TestBench

Projects for Icarus Verilog (http://iverilog.icarus.com/).

## How to Use

- Download Icarus Verilog.
- Run the simulation using `make` (`ROM` can be any `.mem` file under `roms/`, `CYCLES` is the number of cycles to simulate):

```bash
make run ROM=roms/cpu_instrs.mem CYCLES=1000000
```

- Open `dmg_waves.fst` in [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) or [Surfer](https://surfer-project.org/).
- Additionally, you can load prepared signal sets (`debugging_instructions.gtkw`) into GTKWave: File -> Read Save File.
- Think, scratch your head, fix bugs, redo everything.

## Verilator

The simulation can be run in [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/), which is ~35x faster than Icarus Verilog, but it requires a bit more setup.

First, you need a custom build of a fork of [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/), found [on this branch](https://github.com/Rodrigodd/yosys/tree/dmgcpu-changes-2) (or [this commit, to be precise](https://github.com/Rodrigodd/yosys/commit/3ba9b002e5189a83ecfa4da7780d77eb4d2dfb70)). Yosys will be used to convert the current design, which uses high-impedance signals to simulate dynamic logic (unsuitable for simulation in Verilator), into a design that only uses `0` and `1` values and can be simulated with Verilator. For more details, see [this PR](https://github.com/emu-russia/dmgcpu/pull/292).

Set the path to the Yosys binary using the `DMG_YOSYS` environment variable, and run Yosys with the `make` target `yosys`:

```bash
make yosys
```

This will create a `sm83.yosys.v` file that can be used with Verilator (or any other simulator).

Then, run the simulation with `make`:

```bash
make verilator ROM=roms/cpu_instrs.mem CYCLES=1000000
```

This will create a `dmg_waves3.fst` file that can be opened in [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) or [Surfer](https://surfer-project.org/).

Note that `sm83.yosys.v` flattens the entire design, so the hierarchy is lost, and many signals are removed. If you need a particular signal, add a `(* keep *)` attribute to it.

## Testing

The CPU is tested by running individual test ROMs from blargg's [cpu_instrs](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms/tree/master/cpu_instrs) test suite (as well as the single ROM version). These ROMs rely very little on other peripherals of the GameBoy besides the CPU core itself. The necessary peripherals are emulated in the module `Bogus_HW` in `run.v`.

In case of a test failure, a reference trace can be generated by running the emulator [Rodrigodd/gameroy](https://github.com/Rodrigodd/gameroy) with the [wave_trace feature enabled](https://github.com/Rodrigodd/gameroy/pull/17). More specifically [at this commit](https://github.com/Rodrigodd/gameroy/commit/62c91d15e51dd6fc7a87f94b889be6ed91f4e5df), which contains changes that make the emulator behave more like the simulation.

To assist in finding where the traces diverge, the tool [rodrigodd/fst-trace](https://github.com/rodrigodd/fst-merger/) can be used to merge both traces into a single file and create signals that compare some signals of both traces.
